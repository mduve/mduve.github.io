												<h6 class="header">Continuing exploration and process.</h6>
												<p>In January 2018, I set out to redesign the DSP and DSPM to demonstrate internally to our teams the benefits of user informed design. Seven months later, I rolled out my findings as part of a case study that I delivered to team leads and members, in conjunction with an angular application proof-of-concept I developed, to help address usability and performance oversights.</p>

												<h6 class="header">Trainers, Branch Managers and Dispatchers</h6>
												<p>I originally performed interviews with our branch users as early as December 2014. For a full transcript of details, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jo93dzsyqjpowyzFcYdpR7ptkgcW2Ocz0CtI_8BcZ8E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a> </p>
								
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>The Challenge</span></h5>
												<p>Dispatchers, reluctant to abandon IAA's legacy platform, needed new ways to manage stocks, citing poor performance, usability issues, and a bloated interface.</p>
												<p>As previously mentioned, DSPM was built to solve those problems. While it was successful, it still did not address feedback discussed during user research and testing.</p>
												<p>So although DSPM had solved the initial issue of managing stocks, it created a whole new set of problems for DSP. My goal for the "improved" DSP/DSPM was to leverage our knowledge of the user and to improve overall experience.</p>
								
												<h6 class="header">High level goals and Objectives:</h6>
												<ol>
													<li>Better integrate DSP/DSPM by deconstructing and rearchitecting a new workflow</li>
													<li>Provide a responsive, modern layout and ui</li>
													<li>Remove and/or consolidate redundancy</li>

												<h6 class="section-header-sub"><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Discovery &amp; Exploration</h6>
												<p>What I discovered in my process was that there were glaring differences in preferences between large and small branches. I was also surprised to find that the legacy platform showed real advantages over the modernized application, particularly with the time it took to complete the dispatch process as well as training involved with newer users.</p>
												<p>I was willing to reconsider the assumption that a more modern interface is a better interface. Underneath it all, users valued accomplishing their task faster over the options and features given to them in this modernized experience.</p>
												<p>A lot of the negative feedback embedded in user voices was based out of a similar frustration. “How do I accomplish my task faster”? So by consolidating functionality and providing users the ability to say, keep settings, I was able to remove layers of repeated steps needed to perform the necessary tasks.</p>
												<h6 class="section-header-sub"><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> User Interface Design</h6>
												<p>First, I needed to deconstruct DSP’s many features by helping the user concentrate on one task at a time. As a result, I wanted to explore using mobile first methodologies.</p>

												<p>Overall, users felt the "improved" DSP/DSPM interface was pretty intuitive and a step up from the previous design. However, initial testing showed that after completing a dispatch, it became less clear what to do after a dispatch was submitted. The results were encapsulated and used to inform the development of the angular application that I was building in tandem with the mobile design.</p>
								
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>Conclusion</span></h5>
												<p>I delivered both the Mobile POC as well as Angular POC to an internal team of designers and developers. 
													I did not expect to change minds overnight but I do think that I was successful in presenting the 
													case for user driven development which is commonly overlooked when delivering minimal viable product. </p>

												<p>While the "system" would to do most of the tracking behind the scenes, the application still required users to act as gatekeepers. Variables included type of users, vehicle lifecycle, as well as the physical location of the stock. The experience had to be seamless.</p>
												<h6 class="header">High level goals and Objectives:</h6>
												<ol>
													<li>Integrate multiple entry points into a system needed to streamline the process for cancelled stocks, from “request” to “approval” to “settlement”.</li>

												<h4 class="mb-4">Dispatch is an angular application proof-of-concept I developed in 2018. 
													It was presented as part of a case study that I delivered to team leads and members, 
													in conjunction with a mobile application I designed, to help address usability 
													and performance oversights.  </h4>
												<small>All information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of IAA</small>
								
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>Team and Role</span></h5>
												<p>I developed the proof-of-concept application in 2018. It was done independently of team members and without management oversite for the purpose of discovery and introspection.</p>
								
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>The Challenge</span></h5>
												<p>With each of its 3 screens making calls to the backend, the 
												previous application was cumbersome and slow.
												Users complained of performance deficiencies as well as a UI that
												was repetitive. A conversation with my product owner over how to
												consolidate the design revealed that Dispatch could infact use a rewrite.</p>
												<p>After some deliberation, I chose to focus on the client side as a
												viable performance solution. To legitimize what I was trying to accomplish,
												I would keep as much of the original requirements intact as possible.
												As such, I would build as a mobile friendly desktop application. </p>
								
												<h6 class="header">High level goals and Objectives:</h6>
												<ol>
													<li>Demonstrate how web performance optimization could be improved 
														through the use of a client side framework.</li>
													<li>Preserve core acceptance criteria.</li>
												</ol>
								
								
												<h5 class="section-header">The Delivery</h5>
								
												<h6 class="section-header-sub"><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Client Side Framework</h6>
								
												<p>Written in .NET MVC, the previous application employed a surplus of javascript 
													component libraries, including jQueryUI and KendoUI for interface interactions. My intention for picking a
													client side framework would be to show the performance advantage of handling data on the 
													front end before passing to the backend while using as little dependencies as possible.</p>
								
												<p>To execute the "List" and "Map" screens, I went with Angular over React, which offers two-way 
													data binding. Vue.js was also a consideration, although I believed, it just wasn't as much support and documentation available. 
													That being said, I found Angular's CLI tool incredibly helpful and easy 
													to use as it relates to all perspectives of building an angular app (compiling TypeScript and SCSS, creating components and services, linting, testing, and deploying).</p>

												<p>An emphasis was placed on creating a mark that was modern and architectural in style but contained past elements such as color and the brick reference.

												<p>After providing an audit of the site, it was clear that the client's project showcase was in

												<h4 class="mb-5">An initiative by IAA to standardize its legacy applications and services, 
													"Modernization", as it was called, was a large-scale, cross-functional effort 
													that required its development teams to rewrite entire applications to conform 
													to a modern, single code base.
												</h4>
												<small>All information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of IAA</small>
								
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>Team and Role</span></h5>
												<!--<p>Over the course of 4 years, I was involved as a front developer with the modernization of numerous legacy applications.</p>-->
												<p>From 2014-18, I worked with multiple teams, focusing primarily on presentation layer development but also assisting 
													with design, to help standardize over a dozen legacy applications. </p>
								
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>The Challenge</span></h5>
												<p>At the core of the operational business unit sits ASAP, the central hub of IAA's suite of applications, 
													dedicated to providing branch users the ability to complete their day-to-day work tasks. To improve 
													usability, a modern architectural framework was constructed, in addition to new global components, 
													carefully designed and built to ensure the success of their users.</p>
												<p>After implementation was complete, the codebase was shared and duplicated across teams and across 
													products. As such, maintaining a single codebase became increasingly difficult to maintain.
													To eliminate duplication moving forward, an external stylesheet was shared across the network 
													using a CDN while older products, such as Legacy, would required patches.</p>		
												
												<h6 class="header">High level goals and Objectives:</h6>
												<ul>
													<li>Build a single codebase shareable across current and future products.</li>
													<li>Update and maintain an ever growing pattern library.</li>
												</ul>
													
												<h5 class="section-header"><span>The Delivery</span></h5>
												<h6 class="header">Front End Modernization</h6>
												<p>"Front End Modernization" was a concept that had been floated around by business since 2014 
													but didn't reach fever pitch until the middle of 2016 when global components were 
													finally conceived, designed and developed. I was responsible for developing the ui for "Quick Search", 
													"Stock Search Results", and "Stock Detail" while integrating and ensuring code solubility 
													for all new global components across legacy and modern solutions.</p>
												<h5 class="mt-5">Quick Search</h5>
												<p class="img-desc">Quick Search returns recent searches on focus and filtered criteria on input. Users can also tab through and search against various categories without leaving the text field using mousetrap.js. </p>

												<h6 class="header">Standardization</h6>
												<p>Post-Modernization, an internal design system and component library (based off the bootstrap toolkit)
