				<h4>Glenbard Parent Series (GPS) prides itself on presenting only the most 
					distinguished authors, clinicians, and educators at their events. 
					They needed a platform for which to manage and showcase their speaking 
					engagements, in hopes of connecting and strengthening the community at large.  </h4>

				<h5 class="section-header"><span>Team and Role</span></h5>
				<p>I worked directly with the client as the designer and developer for their website. Glenbardgps.org 
				launched in 2015</p>
				<p>I continue to work with the client, managing website updates and enhancements on a yearly basis.</p>

				<h5 class="section-header"><span>The Challenge</span></h5>
				<p>The client was determined to go live by the Fall of 2015, giving me about 3 months to design and 
				develop what was originally scoped as a wordpress themed website. But nearly as soon as we began, 
				new features presented themselves in the form of a fully functioning event calendar. The client needed 
				a website to manage speaking engagements by category and date as well as distribute their content 
				online. Additional requirements included the categorization and archival of events as well as 
				support for bilingual content.</p>
